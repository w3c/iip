  <div id="sotd">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">This early draft has not yet been through any review process. Please do not rely on the contents.</p>
    <p>This document describes the basic requirements for Devanagari script layout and text support on the Web and in eBooks. These requirements provide information for Web technologies such as CSS, HTML and digital publications about how to support users of Devanagari scripts. Currently the document focuses on Devanagari as used for the Hindi and Marathi languages. The information here is developed in conjunction with a <a href="../gap-analysis/deva-gap.html">document that summarises gaps</a> in support on the Web for Devanagari.</p>
<p>The editor's draft of this document is being developed by the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/iip/">India International Program Task Force</a>, part of the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/ig/">Internationalization Interest Group</a>. It will be published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization Working Group</a>. The end target for this document is a Working Group Note.</p>

      <h3>About this document</h3>

      <p>This document provides information about the Devanagari script is used for Hindi and Marathi. </p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>
    </section>

  <section id="h_gap_analysis">
  <h3>Gap analysis</h3>

    <p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="../gap-analysis/deva-gap.html">Devanagari Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Devanagari on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>

  <section id="h_info_requests">
  <h3>Other related resources</h3>

    <p>The document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/">International text layout and typography index</a> (known informally as the text layout index) points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>
<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>
<p>This document also uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ilreq/">Indic Layout Requirements</a> as a source for certain information.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
<h2>Devanagari Script Overview</h2>
    <p>Devanagari is an abugida.  Consonant letters have an inherent vowel sound. Combining vowel-signs are attached to the consonant to indicate that a different vowel follows the consonant.</p>
<p>The orthographic syllable is the unit for various aspects of the behaviour of the script. The alphabet is split into vowels and consonants. With one exception (a), each vowel is represented by both an independent version and a combining vowel sign. </p>
<p>Text runs horizontally, left to right, and lines typically break at the spaces between words. </p>
<p>The script has no upper-/lowercase distinction. </p>
<p>The basic unit for text segmentation is the syllable. Unicode grapheme clusters don't cover consonant clusters, so some additional processing is needed to identify text unit boundaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/devanagari/">Devanagari script summary</a> can be read for a high level overview of characters used for the script, and some basic features. Text from that the latter part of that page was used for the initial version of this document.</p>

<section id="h_graphemes">
<h3 class="reviewme">Grapheme boundaries</h3>
<p>The basic unit for working with Devanagari text is the orthographic syllable, ie. one consonant or a sequence of consonants with halant between, plus optional additional combining characters (such as vowel-signs).</p>
<p>In Devanagari an orthographic syllable that forms a conjunct should be treated as an indivisible unit of text for most editing operations.  <a href="#fig_grapheme_conjunct"></a> shows a Devanagari word with a conjunct at the end, and the expected segmentation.</p>
<figure id="fig_grapheme_conjunct">
<p class="large"><span class="ex" lang="hi">हिन्दी&nbsp;&nbsp;→&nbsp; हि+न्दी</span></p>
<figcaption>Expected minimal units (right) during segmentation of the word <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex">हिन्‌दी</span> <span class="trans">hindī</span></span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If, however, a conjunct is not formed and the halant is visible, the first consonant plus halant would be treated as separate from the second consonant, and the vowel-sign would appear to the left of the second consonant (see <a href="#fig_grapheme_sequence"></a>).</p>
<figure id="fig_grapheme_sequence">
<p class="large"><span class="ex" lang="hi">हिन्‌दी&nbsp;&nbsp;→&nbsp; हि+न्‌+‌दी</span></p>
<figcaption>Expected  segmentation of the word <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">हिन्दी</span> <span class="trans">hindī</span></span> when there is no conjunct.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that in Devanagari an orthographic syllable may be longer than a Unicode grapheme cluster, if it forms a conjunct.  <a href="#fig_grapheme_cluster"></a> shows a Devanagari word with a conjunct at the end, and the  segmentation that would result from applying Unicode grapheme clusters only.</p>
<figure id="fig_grapheme_cluster">
<p class="large"><span class="ex" lang="hi">हिन्‌दी&nbsp;&nbsp;→&nbsp;हि+न्‌+‌दी</span></p>
<figcaption>Segmentation of the word <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">हिन्दी</span> <span class="trans">hindī</span></span> with a conjunct when using Unicode grapheme clusters.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For Devanagari, applications need to provide tailored extensions to correctly segment the text. Such tailoring needs to be able to distinguish between sequences that are displayed as conjuncts, and those where the halant is visible.</p>
</section>




<section id="h_words">
      <h3 class="reviewme">Word boundaries</h3>
<p>Words are separated by spaces.</p>
<p>Devanagari has hyphenated words – mainly conjoined nouns, eg. <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">लाभ-हानि</span> <span class="trans">lābʰ-hāni</span> <span class="meaning">profit-loss</span></span>, and <span class="charExample" translate="no"><span class="ex" lang="hi">माता-पिता</span> <span class="trans">mātā-pitā</span> <span class="meaning">parents</span></span>. <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ilreq/">i</a></sup></p>
</section>




<section id="h_danda">
      <h3 class="reviewme">Phrase boundaries: Danda &amp; double danda</h3>
<p><span class="codepoint"><span lang="hi">।</span> [<span class="uname">U+0964 DEVANAGARI DANDA</span>]</span>, is used for sentence final punctuation.</p>
<p>There are two alternative approaches to the use of spaces with danda:</p>
<ol>
<li>No space character appears between the end of the phrase and the danda glyph, but the advance width of the danda in a font should open a small gap before it. The danda is then typically followed by a single space.</li>
<li>A space is allowed before and after the danda in order to balance the space before and after it. In this case, the danda must still be kept from wrapping to a new line on its own; it should wrap with the previous word and space together.</li>
</ol>
<p>These same principles apply to <span class="codepoint"><span lang="hi">॥</span> [<span class="uname">U+0965 DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA</span>]</span>.</p>
<p>The double danda should be written using the dedicated Unicode character, and not by combining two single dandas.</p>
<p>The double danda is sometimes used to set apart section or verse numbering, in which the number is placed between pairs of double dandas. To obtain the correct spacing, the character sequence is usually &lt;double danda, space, numeral(s), double danda&gt;.</p>
</section>




<section id="h_quotations">
      <h3 class="reviewme">Quotations</h3>
<p>The default quote marks for Devanagari should be <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x201C;</span> [<span class="uname">U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span> at the start, and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x201D;</span> [<span class="uname">U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span> at the end. </p>
<p>When an additional quote is embedded within the first, the quote marks should be <span class="ex" lang="lo"><span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x2018;</span> [<span class="uname">U+2018 LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span> and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x2019;</span> [<span class="uname">U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span></span>. &nbsp; <span class="ednote">This is according to CLDR – need to check.</span></p>
</section>




<section id="h_segmentation">
      <h3>Font styles</h3>
<p>Italics and  bold are not traditional feature of Devanagari text.</p>
</section>




<section id="h_text_decoration">
      <h3>Text decoration</h3>
      <p>Underlining is not traditional feature of Devanagari text</p>
    </section>



</section>






<section id="h_lines_and_paragraphs">
<h2>Line &amp; paragraph layout</h2>

<section id="h_line_breaking">
<h3 class="reviewme">Line breaking</h3>
<p>The primary break opportunities for line breaking are at inter-word spaces.</p>
<p>If a line is broken inside a word, any consonant clusters should be kept intact unless they are separated by visible halant characters (see <a href="#h_graphemes"></a>).</p>
<p>Line breaking should not move a danda or double danda to the beginning of a new line, even if they are preceded by a space character. These punctuation characters should behave in the same way as a full stop does in English text.</p>
</section>


<section id="h_counters">
<h3 class="reviewme">Counters</h3>
<p>Counters are used to number lists, chapter headings, etc. </p>
<p>Devanagari uses a numeric counter style, based on the decimal model, and using the standard Devanagari digits,'०' '१' '२' '३' '४' '५' '६' '७' '८' '९' in a decimal pattern.</p>
<div class="figwrap">
<figure id="counter-styles">
<p class="large">1&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex" lang="hi">१</span> 2&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex" lang="hi">२</span> 3&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex" lang="hi">३</span> 4&nbsp;⇨&nbsp;<span class="ex" lang="hi">४</span> <br>

<figcaption>Examples of counter values using the Devanagari numeric counter style.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Devanagari also uses an alphabetic counter style,  based on the following letters, 'क' 'ख' 'ग' 'घ' 'ङ' 'च' 'छ' 'ज' 'झ' 'ञ' 'ट' 'ठ' 'ड' 'ढ' 'ण' 'त' 'थ' 'द' 'ध' 'न' 'प' 'फ' 'ब' 'भ' 'म' 'य' 'र' 'ल' 'व' 'श' 'ष' 'स' 'ह'.</p>

<section id="h_styling_initials">
<h3 class="reviewme">Styling initials</h3>
    <p> Devanagari content does sometimes enlarge the first part of the first word in a paragraph, in a similar way to drop caps. Instead of enlarging just the first letter in the word, it is normal to enlarge the first orthographic syllable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="images/first_letter.png" alt=""></p>
    <figcaption>Enlarged syllable styling at the start of a paragraph.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In theory, the shirorekha should align in the large text and the following first line, however many implementations don't achieve this very well.</p>
<p>It is  common to see such initial-syllable enlargement centred inside a coloured box.</p>
