      <h1 id="title">DRAFT W3C India International Program Charter</h1>
      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of this task force is to
        ensure that the World Wide Web fully addresses the needs of the global
        Indic language community. To do this, it will document, and take steps
        to help developers fill, gaps in W3C technologies in particular, and the
        Web in general, in support of the major languages of India, where those
        languages are used by Web standards such as HTML, CSS, TTML, and in 
        applications, particularly Digital Publishing. </p>
      <p class="mission">The group will begin by identifying aspects of script
        and language support that currently do not work well in browsers and
        ereaders, and will document the gaps. In parallel, it will develop tests to assess levels of support for the features identified, and document the
        requirements for those features, so that implementers and standards
        developers understand what needs to be supported. The task force will
        also work with the latter to help them provide support for appropriate
        features. This may include  raising bug
        reports, raising issues against specifications, etc.</p>
      <p class="mission">The Task Force is part of the Internationalization
        Interest Group, which is part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/">W3C
          Internationalization activity</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>This work aims to ensure that the W3C is developing a Web for All,
          but there is also a particular emphasis on supporting developments
          related to epublishing in India.</p>
<p>The main objective of the task force is to document
  typographic and layout requirements for languages using 
  Indian scripts on the Web and in digital publications. These requirements should be met in Web
  standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, SVG, and
Digital Publication technologies.</p>
<p>An important starting point for the group will be to investigate current gaps in support for Indian languages on the Web, and produce documentation about that. Those findings will then be motivators for the creation of a document that describes the requirements for Indic language support. Those requirements will describe how the Indian scripts should work, without reference to specific technologies (those references belong in the gap analysis outputs).</p>

<p>In addition to those specifications, the group may do the following: 
  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer questions for the Internationalization WG and other W3C WGs related to the implementation of Mongolian support in specifications and implementations.</li>
  <li>Review W3C specifications, especially CSS, to ensure that Traditional Mongolian is adequately supported.    </li>
<li>Create tests to support documentation of gaps and to help check implementations.</li>
<li>Translate W3C resources into Mongolian.</li>
</ul>

<p>The group may aim to intersect with technologies that include the
          following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital Publications</li>
          <li>CSS3 Modules, in particular:
            <ul>
              <li>CSS3 Writing Modes Working Draft</li>
              <li>CSS3 Text</li>
              <li>CSS3 Lists</li>
              <li>CSS3 Writing Modes</li>
              <li>CSS3 Fonts</li>
              <li>CSS3 Counter Styles</li>
              <li>CSS3 Inline Layout</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>TTML</li>
          <li>SVG</li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>Initial set of languages</h3>
        <p>Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam are likely to provide a good starting point. These and additional languages will be included
          based on the availability of linguistic and typographic experts.  It
          is envisioned that the Task Force will help prioritize the languages
          to be addressed and work with the Internationalization Interest Group
          to identify and recruit individuals and organizations with expertise
          in each language to participate in the Task Force. </p>
      </div>
      <p> </p>
      <div>
        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
        <p>The Indic Task Force will not produce Recommendation-track
          deliverables but will produce documents that can be published by the
          Internationalization Working Group as Working Group Notes. The
          deliverables will include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
<p>The results of a gap-analysis survey of Indic script and language
            features that are currently problematic for the support of major
            Indic languages on the Web and in e-publications. The gap analysis will prioritise the impact and urgency of unsupported features using criteria developed with the Internationalization WG. The gap analysis reports should be specific about which languages they are addressing. It is expected that a separate gap analysis report will be produced for each writing system, but where languages share the same writing system and are similar in nature they may be included in the same report, as long as it is clear in the report which language a particular comment or set of comments is related to.</p>
        <p>The gap analysis will be done in two stages:</p>
          <ul>
<li>A  preliminary version can be produced quickly with a small number of experts. The information will be added to the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">W3C language matrix</a>.</li>
<li>A more detailed version of the gap analysis report, preferably with test cases and links to existing requirements information. After an initial effort, this information may be added to on an ongoing basis as new issues arise, or as gaps are closed. The results will again be reflected in the W3C language matrix.</li>
</ul>

</li><li>
<p>One or more documents entitled "Text Layout Requirements for XXX
            Script Languages", where XXX could be Indic (and include all
            scripts), or could represent a particular type of script (such as
            North Indian vs South Indian), or could be a single specific script.
            (It is recommended that Urdu in the Arabic script be handled in a separate document.) These documents should be modeled on the Japanese Layout
            Requirements document to the extent that they represent a
            description of how the script should work, and be free of references
            to any particular technology. This will ensure that the document is
            widely relevant and evergreen. W3C India has already done some work
            on layout requirements for Indian Languages. A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ilreq/">
              Working Draft</a> is available. This work will be merged into the
            deliverables of this task force, and adapted as appropriate. Such documents should at least document the requirements for unsupported features that are identified during the gap analysis work, but can go beyond that to describe how the script functions.</p>
</li>
          <li>
<p>A set of recommendations for addressing the gaps in support for
            Indic scripts in particular technologies. The format of these
            recommendations is TBD, and could range from a set of github issues,
            to one or more WG Notes.   There will be some way of identifying and
            tracking progress on the recommendations made.  The Task Force will
            take advice on the methodology used for that from the i18n WG and will apply it to all Indic scripts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The wider W3C framework into which this work fits is described in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-discuss/wiki/Analysing-support-for-text-layout-on-the-Web">Analysing support for text layout on the Web</a>.</p>
        <p>The group will also need to produce other non-normative
          deliverables. These include test cases and their results, under the terms
          of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases">Policies for
            Contribution of Test Cases</a>,  which should be developed in coordination with the i18n WG and any other
          relevant working groups. The tests will help indicate the areas where features are needed or missing. Tests and results will follow the
          format required for the I18n Test Suite and Web Platform Tests
          repositories.</p>
        <h3>Milestones</h3>
        <p>Plans for the main deliverables are as follows. Rows should be duplicated for targeted scripts/languages, once a decision has been made as to the initial linguistic scope of the project:</p>

        <p>Other WG deliverables are produced on an ongoing basis throughout the
          life of the charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the
          task force and schedule information cannot be determined far in
          advance, but are driven by the needs of the Web community.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
      <p>The success of the Task Force will be based on how well it manages to
        identify and describe requirements for features needed on the Web for
        support of Indian languages and scripts. Success will also be measured
        by how productively the Task Force engages with W3C members and the
        community in India to promote discussion of Indic text layout related
        specifications, and how effectively it is able to contribute to
        e-publishing initiatives in India. </p>
      <p>While it is envisioned that the Task Force will produce a document for
        each Indic script, minimally the group will be expected to provide one
        document describing gaps in support for the Indic scripts and languages
        identified in Section 1.1, and a separate document describing the
        requirements for those scripts and language gaps.</p>

      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
      <p>To be successful, the India International Program Task Force is expected to have
        8 or more active participants for its duration.</p>
      <p>Participants are reminded of the <a href="/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good
Standing
          requirements</a> of the W3C Process.</p>
<p>People contributing substantive text to the deliverables must be public invited experts or work for W3C member organizations, in order to meet the policy requirements of section 7 of this charter.</p>
Participants who join the India International Program Task Force must also agree to the following:

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>Copyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.</p>
<p>In the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.</p>
<p> Task Force Participants  grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.</p>
<p>Nothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C. </p>
<h3>Decency</h3>
<p>The Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants.  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria">Section 3.1 of the Process Document</a> applies. </p>
<p>The Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="communication">
      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
      <p>India International Program Task Force discussions mostly take place via GitHub
        issues, email and a regular heartbeat teleconference. Discussions may
        use the local language, where useful, but discussions should be
        summarised in English, and any Notes or other reports will be made
        available in English.</p>
      <p>The India International Program Task Force primarily conducts its work on the
        GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/ilreq/">https://github.com/w3c/ilreq/</a>.
        Daily and weekly digests of issues in the mlreq GitHub repository are posted to www-international@w3.org and public-i18n-core@w3.org, respectively.</p>
<p>There is also a publicly archived mailing
        list public-i18n-indic@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-indic/">archive</a>),
        which can be used to carry announcements for the public and where
        meeting minutes will be sent. Meeting minutes must list all attendees at
        a meeting. The public-i18n-indic@w3.org list must archive or point to
  minutes and summaries of all teleconferences and face-to-face
  meetings. Meeting minutes will list all attendees at a given
meeting.</p>
      <p>An additional mailing list, public-ilreq-admin@w3.org, is available for
        administrative work and posting of meeting agendas. The list is publicly
        readable, but only writeable by members of the task force. Meeting
        agenda, should be published before each teleconference or face-to-face
        meeting.</p>
      <p>The group will use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/">
          Internationalization Activity home page </a> to provide updated
        public information about its activities.</p>
      <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face

      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
          3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
        consensus. In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group
        resolution about a particular issue, its Chair will put a question about
        the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal
        objections); then, after due consideration of all the responses, the
        Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and
        also along with responding to any formal objections).</p>

<h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy </h2>
      <p>Participants in the India International Program Task Force are obligated to
        comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy as outlined out in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
          6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy document. Although the Indic Text
        Layout Task Force is not chartered to produce Recommendation-track
        documents that themselves require patent disclosure, participants in the
        group are nevertheless obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure
        policy for any Recommendation-track specifications that they review or
        comment on.</p>
      <p>For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
        please see the <a href="/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy
          Implementation</a>.</p>
