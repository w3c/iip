# India International Program task force

This task force explores gaps in Indian language support on the Web and in eBooks, and documents requirements.

It aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention. You can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=ilreq) page. (That link applies an `ilreq` filter.)

For more details about scope, deliverables, work methods, etc., see the [group's charter](https://w3c.github.io/iip/charter/).
